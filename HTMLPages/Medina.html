      <h2>About the City</h2>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Medina[a], officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: المدينة
        المنورة‎, romanized: al-Madinat al-Munawwarah, lit. 'The Enlightened
        City'), commonly simplified as Madīnah or Madinah, is one of the three
        holiest cities in Islam and the capital of the Medina Region of Saudi
        Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782,[1]
        making it the fourth-most populous city in the country.[2] Located at
        the core of the Madinah Province in the western reaches of the country,
        the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles),
        293 km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the city's urban area, while
        the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys,
        agricultural spaces, older dormant volcanoes and the Nafud desert.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in
        Islamic tradition, the other two being Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid
        al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of
        exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last
        Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat
        at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory.[3] The
        original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib and it
        is referred to by the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab
        (The Confederates). It was renamed Madīnat an-Nabī (City of the Prophet
        or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah
        al-Munawwarah (The Enlightened City), before being simplified and
        shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in English as
        Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah
        al-Munawwarah interchangeably.[3]
