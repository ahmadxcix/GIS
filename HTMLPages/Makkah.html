      <h2>History</h2>

      <h3>Etymology</h3>

      <p>
        Mecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, the
        etymology of Makkah is obscure.[15] Widely believed to be a synonym for
        Mecca, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley
        located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the
        sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the
        Ka'bah.[16][17]
        <br />
        <br />
        <b> Bakkah </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Qur'an refers to the city as Bakkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96,
        <br />
        <br />

        "Indeed the first House [of worship], established for mankind was that
        at Bakkah..." – Qur'an 3:96

        <br />
        <br />
        This is presumed to have been the name of the city at the time of
        Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition) and it is also transliterated as
        Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca, Bekka, among others.[18][19][20]
        <br />
        <br />
        <b> Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        In South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the
        Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, the b and m were
        interchangeable. This is presumed to have been the origin of the current
        form of the name. "Makkah" is the official transliteration used by the
        Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation.[21][22] The
        government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but is
        not universally known or used worldwide.[21] The full official name is
        Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: مكة المكرمة‎, romanized: Makkat
        al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Honored').[21] "Makkah" is used to refer
        to the city in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.[15][23]
        <br />
        <br />

        The word "Mecca" in English has come to be used to refer to any place
        that draws large numbers of people, and because of this some
        English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this spelling
        for the city as offensive.[21] Mecca is the familiar form of the English
        transliteration for the Arabic name of the city, The consensus in
        academic scholarship is that "Macoraba", the place mentioned in Arabia
        Felix by Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca. Many etymologies have been proposed
        but the most suitable one is that it is derived from the Old South
        Arabian root "M-K-R-B" which means temple.[24][25]
