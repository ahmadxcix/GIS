      <p>
        Riyadh (Arabic: الرياض‎, romanized: ar-Riyāḍ, lit. 'The Gardens'
        [ar.riˈjaːdˤ] Najdi pronunciation: [er.rɪˈjɑːðˤ]) is the capital city
        and seat of government of the Riyadh Province and the Kingdom of Saudi
        Arabia, the largest city on the Arabian Peninsula and the capital
        governorate of the Riyadh Province. Located in the center of the
        an-Nafud desert, on the eastern part of the Najd plateau, the city sits
        at an average of 600 metres (2,000 ft) above sea level,[2] and receives
        more than 16 million tourists each year, making it the 2nd most visited
        city in the Arab world.[3] Riyadh had a population of 7.6 million people
        in 2019, making it the most populous city in Saudi Arabia, 2nd most
        populous city in the Arab world (after Cairo), and the 38th most
        populous in Asia.[1]

        The first mentioning of the city by the name Riyadh was in 1590, by an
        early Arab chronicler.[4] In 1737, Deham Ibn Dawwas, who was from the
        neighboring Manfuha, settled in and took control of the city. Deham
        built a wall around the city, and the best known source of the name
        Riyadh is from this period, thought to be referring to the earlier oasis
        towns that predated the wall built by Ibn Dawwas.[5] In 1744, Muhammad
        ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah,
        Muhammad bin Saud, and in 1774, they took Riyadh from Deham. However
        their state, now known as the First Saudi State, came to a collapse in
        1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the Second Saudi State in the early
        19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However, his reign
        over the city was disrupted by a joint Ottoman–Rashidi alliance.
        Finally, in the early 20th century, 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud, known in the
        west simply as Ibn Saud, retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902
        and consolidated his rule by 1926 with the final Saudi conquest of
        Hejaz.[6] After this he named his kingdom Saudi Arabia in September
        1932[6] with Riyadh as the capital.[7]s
